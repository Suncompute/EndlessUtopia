# 🌌 EndlessUtopia  
*A coordinate‑based ASCII exploration world*

EndlessUtopia is an infinite, coordinate‑driven ASCII world designed for wandering, glitch‑inspired discovery, and quiet creative rituals.  
There are no quests, no enemies, no goals — only space, symbols, and the subtle feeling of being somewhere that keeps unfolding.

This project is part experiment, part meditative tool, part indie game.  
Every coordinate generates a unique ASCII landscape. Every movement reveals something new.  
Sometimes a creature appears. Sometimes nothing happens at all.

## ✨ Features

### **Infinite ASCII World**  
Navigate an endless 2D plane where each coordinate produces a unique pattern, glyph field, or glitch artifact.

### **Coordinate Teleportation**  
Jump to any location instantly — explore faraway regions, hidden anomalies, or the void between.

### **ASCII Graffiti**  
Leave marks, symbols, or small rituals in the world. They may never be seen again, or they may become part of the landscape.

### **Wandering Entities**  
Rare encounters with ASCII beings — a cat, a glitch, an echo. They appear unexpectedly and vanish just as quietly.

### **Minimalist Interface**  
No UI clutter. No noise. Just you and the world.
