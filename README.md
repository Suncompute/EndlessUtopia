EndlessUtopia
A coordinate‑based ASCII exploration world
EndlessUtopia is an infinite, coordinate‑driven ASCII world designed for wandering, glitch‑inspired discovery, and quiet creative rituals.
There are no quests, no enemies, no goals — only space, symbols, and the subtle feeling of being somewhere that keeps unfolding.
This project is part experiment, part meditative tool, part indie game.
Every coordinate generates a unique ASCII landscape. Every movement reveals something new.
Sometimes a creature appears. Sometimes nothing happens at all.

✨ Features
- Infinite ASCII World
Navigate an endless 2D plane where each coordinate produces a unique pattern, glyph field, or glitch artifact.
- Coordinate Teleportation
Jump to any location instantly — explore faraway regions, hidden anomalies, or the void between.
- ASCII Graffiti
Leave marks, symbols, or small rituals in the world. They may never be seen again, or they may become part of the landscape.
- Wandering Entities
Rare encounters with ASCII beings — a cat, a glitch, an echo. They appear unexpectedly and vanish just as quietly.
- Minimalist Interface
No UI clutter. No noise. Just you and the world.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
- A modern browser (for the WASM version)
- Or a local runtime (if running the standalone build)
Running the Browser Version
npm install
npm run dev


Then open the local development URL in your browser.
Running the Standalone Version
cargo run


(Or whatever runtime your implementation uses — adjust as needed.)

🧠 Philosophy
EndlessUtopia is not a game you win.
It is a place you visit.
A place for:
- wandering
- glitch‑watching
- quiet creation
- meditative exploration
- ASCII rituals
The world does not reward you.
It simply responds to your presence.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- RUST for Programming
